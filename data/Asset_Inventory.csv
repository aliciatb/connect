INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING DATA SET
Do not pull down the data set and use it without using the code book. When you run the data set, be sure to refer to the Code Book for invalid or missing values for each question item (variables). 
You must recognize that the data here is unweighted; to replicate the figures in the City’s Information Technology Access and Adoption Report and get values that are representative of Seattle population, you should use the weights. There are 2 weighting variables, one that allows you to use the phone and online survey together (labeled ""weightfin"") and one that is for only the phone survey (labeled ""wgtphoneonly"", which excludes or zeros out everyone in the online survey).",,,data.seattle.gov,,,true,communitytechnology@seatte.gov,2014-04-25T20:55Z,Public Domain,https://data.seattle.gov/resource/nyj5-2t3f.json,,,,,2014-04-25T21:03Z,972,,Community,,dataset,nyj5-2t3f

This project is managed by our Community Technology Program with technical advice from our Citizens Telecommunications and Technology Advisory Board (CTTAB).  
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING DATA SET
Do not pull down the data set and use it without using the code book. When you run the data set, be sure to refer to the Code Book for invalid or missing values for each question item (variables). 
You must recognize that the data here is unweighted; to replicate the figures in the City’s Information Technology Access and Adoption Report and get values that are representative of Seattle population, you should use the weights. There are 2 weighting variables, one that allows you to use the phone and online survey together (labeled ""weightfin"") and one that is for only the phone survey (labeled ""wgtphoneonly"", which excludes or zeros out everyone in the online survey).",,,data.seattle.gov,,,true,communitytechnology@seattle.gov,2014-04-25T20:34Z,Public Domain,https://data.seattle.gov/resource/s98k-8imb.json,,,,,2014-04-25T21:34Z,1005,,Community,,dataset,s98k-8imb

Since 2000, the City's Information Technology Indicators project has been collecting extensive and statistically valid data on residential use of cable tv, broadband adoption and uses (including health, work, education, finance and civic engagement), barriers to broadband adoption, and customer service needs. This project is managed by our Community Technology Program with technical advice from our Citizens Telecommunications and Technology Advisory Board (CTTAB).  
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING DATA SET
Do not pull down the data set and use it without using the code book. When you run the data set, be sure to refer to the Code Book for invalid or missing values for each question item (variables). 
You must recognize that the data here is unweighted; to replicate the figures in the City’s Information Technology Access and Adoption Report and get values that are representative of Seattle population, you should use the weights. There are 2 weighting variables, one that allows you to use the phone and online survey together (labeled ""weightfin"") and one that is for only the phone survey (labeled ""wgtphoneonly"", which excludes or zeros out everyone in the online survey).",,,data.seattle.gov,,,true,,2015-09-21T01:24Z,Public Domain,https://data.seattle.gov/resource/nhxm-brnf.json,,,,,2014-04-25T21:03Z,77,,Community,,filter,nhxm-brnf

Each row contains the record of a unique event where at least one criminal offense was reported by a member of the community or detected by an officer in the field. This data is the same data used in meetings such as SeaStat (https://www.seattle.gov/police/information-and-data/seastat) for strategic planning, accountability and performance management.  

These data contain offenses and offense categorization coded to simulate the standard reported to the FBI under the National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) and used to generate Uniform Crime Report (UCR) summary statistics. As these records evolve, daily and are continually refreshed, they will not match official UCR statistics. They represent a more accurate state of the record. 

Previous versions of this data set have withheld approximately 40% of crimes. This updated process includes all records of crime reports logged in the Departments Records Management System (RMS) since 2008, which are tracked as part of the SeaStat process. In an effort to safeguard the privacy of our community, offense reports will only be located to the “beat” level. Location specific coordinates will no longer be provided. 

Beats are the most granular unit of management used for patrol deployment. To learn more about patrol deployment, please visit: https://www.seattle.gov/police/about-us/about-policing/precinct-and-patrol-boundaries. In addition to the Departments patrol deployment areas, these data contain the “Neighborhood” where the crime occurred, if available. This coding is used to align crime data with the Micro Community Policing Plan (MCPP). For more information see: https://www.seattle.gov/police/community-policing/about-mcpp.

that are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information 
from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically 
Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database 
(MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or
 gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand 
alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the 
entire nation. Census Blocks are statistical areas bounded on all sides 
by visible features, such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad 
tracks, and/or by nonvisible boundaries such as city, town, township, 
and county limits, and short line-of-sight extensions of streets and 
roads. Census blocks are relatively small in area; for example, a block 
in a city bounded by streets. However, census blocks in remote areas are
 often large and irregular and may even be many square miles in area. A 
common misunderstanding is that data users think census blocks are used 
geographically to build all other census geographic areas, rather all 
other census geographic areas are updated and then used as the primary 
constraints, along with roads and water features, to delineate the 
tabulation blocks. As a result, all 2010 Census blocks nest within every
 other 2010 Census geographic area, so that Census Bureau statistical 
data can be tabulated at the block level and aggregated up to the 
appropriate geographic areas. Census blocks cover all territory in the 
United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas (American Samoa, Guam, 
the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin 
Islands). Blocks are the smallest geographic areas for which the Census

Each row contains the record of a unique event where at least one criminal offense was reported by a member of the community or detected by an officer in the field. This data is the same data used in meetings such as SeaStat (https://www.seattle.gov/police/information-and-data/seastat) for strategic planning, accountability and performance management.  

These data contain offenses and offense categorization coded to simulate the standard reported to the FBI under the National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) and used to generate Uniform Crime Report (UCR) summary statistics. As these records evolve, daily and are continually refreshed, they will not match official UCR statistics. They represent a more accurate state of the record. 

Previous versions of this data set have withheld approximately 40% of crimes. This updated process includes all records of crime reports logged in the Departments Records Management System (RMS) since 2008, which are tracked as part of the SeaStat process. In an effort to safeguard the privacy of our community, offense reports will only be located to the “beat” level. Location specific coordinates will no longer be provided. 

Beats are the most granular unit of management used for patrol deployment. To learn more about patrol deployment, please visit: https://www.seattle.gov/police/about-us/about-policing/precinct-and-patrol-boundaries. In addition to the Departments patrol deployment areas, these data contain the “Neighborhood” where the crime occurred, if available. This coding is used to align crime data with the Micro Community Policing Plan (MCPP). For more information see: https://www.seattle.gov/police/community-policing/about-mcpp. 

As with any data, certain condition and qualifications apply:
1)	These data are refreshed, daily and represent the most accurate, evolved state of the record. 

2)	Due to quality control processes, these data will lag between 2 and 6 weeks.

Each row is a record of a Call for Service (CfS) logged with the Seattle Police Department (SPD) Communications Center. Calls originated from the community and range from in progress or active emergencies to requests for problem solving. Additionally, officers will log calls from their observations of the field. 

Previous versions of this data set have withheld approximately 40% of calls. This updated process will release more than 95% of all calls but we will no longer provide latitude and longitude specific location data. In an effort to safeguard the privacy of our community, calls will only be located to the “beat” level. Beats are the most granular unit of management used for patrol deployment. To learn more about patrol deployment, please visit: https://www.seattle.gov/police/about-us/about-policing/precinct-and-patrol-boundaries.

As with any data, certain conditions and qualifications apply:

1)	These data are queried from the Data Analytics Platform (DAP), and updated incrementally on a daily basis. A full refresh will occur twice a year and is intended to reconcile minor changes.

2)	This data set only contains records of police response. If a call is queued in the system but cleared before an officer can respond, it will not be included. 

3)	These data contain administrative call types. Use the “Initial” and “Final” call type to identify the calls you wish to include in your analysis.

blocks are grouped into block groups, which are grouped into census 
tracts. There are on average about 39 blocks per block group. Blocks 
typically have a four-digit number; the first number indicates which 
block group the block is in. For example, census block 3019 would be in 
block group 3.

Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 
people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. A census tract usually 
covers a contiguous area; however, the spatial size of census tracts 
varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Census tract

Policing Plans (MCPP) were designed to address the distinctive needs of

direct feedback on perceptions of crime and public safety. MCPP are 
tailored to meet the individual needs of each community, with a unique 
approach owned by the community.</p>
<strong>Why are Perceptions of Crime Important?</strong>
<p>Citizen perceptions of crime and public safety matter. When used in 
conjunction with crime data, citizen perceptions at the micro-community 
level provide a more accurate picture of the reality of crime and public
 safety than can be seen through crime statistics alone.   This is what 
makes the MCPP strategy unique. </p>
<strong>How were the Neighborhoods Defined?</strong>
The MCPP neighborhoods were defined through police-citizen engagement
 including community meetings, focus groups, survey data, and the 
realities of geographic boundaries SPD can use to collect and report on 
events. The MCPPs and their neighborhoods will be routinely reevaluated 
with attention to the ways in which citizens who live in Seattle

The Census Bureau delineates census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where state, local, or tribal governments declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of statistical data.

Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people.  A census tract usually covers a contiguous area; however, the spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement.  Census tract boundaries are delineated with the intention of being maintained over a long time so that statistical comparisons can be made from census to census.  Census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth or merged as a result of substantial population decline.",,,data.seattle.gov,,,true,,2018-11-08T19:23Z,https://hub.arcgis.com/api/v2/datasets/9dfa62d1cf594b6db26b3ee44867c72a_6/license,https://data.seattle.gov/resource/g44v-w4kd.json,,,,,2018-11-08T19:23Z,0,"boundaries,census,census tract,demographics,gis,planning,seattle,tract,us census",Land Base,,href,g44v-w4kd

The Seattle Office for Civil Rights (SOCR) receives calls on the Bias Incident Reporting Line. Calls are received by front desk staff and logged. This dataset shows the amount of calls received each quarter of 2017 by protected class. A protected class is a characteristic of a person that is protected by the laws SOCR enforces such as race, gender identity, or disability. An “uncategorized” protected class means the caller did not provide a protected class.

Each row contains the record of a unique event where at least one criminal offense was reported by a member of the community or detected by an officer in the field. This data is the same data used in meetings such as SeaStat (https://www.seattle.gov/police/information-and-data/seastat) for strategic planning, accountability and performance management.  

These data contain offenses and offense categorization coded to simulate the standard reported to the FBI under the National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) and used to generate Uniform Crime Report (UCR) summary statistics. As these records evolve, daily and are continually refreshed, they will not match official UCR statistics. They represent a more accurate state of the record. 

Previous versions of this data set have withheld approximately 40% of crimes. This updated process includes all records of crime reports logged in the Departments Records Management System (RMS) since 2008, which are tracked as part of the SeaStat process. In an effort to safeguard the privacy of our community, offense reports will only be located to the “beat” level. Location specific coordinates will no longer be provided. 

Beats are the most granular unit of management used for patrol deployment. To learn more about patrol deployment, please visit: https://www.seattle.gov/police/about-us/about-policing/precinct-and-patrol-boundaries. In addition to the Departments patrol deployment areas, these data contain the “Neighborhood” where the crime occurred, if available. This coding is used to align crime data with the Micro Community Policing Plan (MCPP). For more information see: https://www.seattle.gov/police/community-policing/about-mcpp. 

As with any data, certain condition and qualifications apply:
1)	These data are refreshed, daily and represent the most accurate, evolved state of the record. 

2)	Due to quality control processes, these data will lag between 2 and 6 weeks. Most changes...",,,data.seattle.gov,,,true,,2018-10-23T19:20Z,Public Domain,https://data.seattle.gov/resource/fys2-hpqe.json,,,,,2019-03-13T09:07Z,2,,Public Safety,,chart,fys2-hpqe

Buildings account for 33% of Seattle's core emissions. The benchmarking policy supports Seattle's goals to reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions from existing buildings. In 2013, the City of Seattle adopted a Climate Action Plan to achieve zero net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050. Annual benchmarking, reporting and disclosing of building performance are foundational elements of creating more market value for energy efficiency.
Per Ordinance (125000), starting with 2015 energy use performance reporting, the City of Seattle will make the data for all building 20,000 SF and larger available annually. This update to the benchmarking mandate was passed by Seattle City Council on February 29, 2016.

Each row contains the record of a unique event where at least one criminal offense was reported by a member of the community or detected by an officer in the field. This data is the same data used in meetings such as SeaStat (https://www.seattle.gov/police/information-and-data/seastat) for strategic planning, accountability and performance management.  

These data contain offenses and offense categorization coded to simulate the standard reported to the FBI under the National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) and used to generate Uniform Crime Report (UCR) summary statistics. As these records evolve, daily and are continually refreshed, they will not match official UCR statistics. They represent a more accurate state of the record. 

Previous versions of this data set have withheld approximately 40% of crimes. This updated process includes all records of crime reports logged in the Departments Records Management System (RMS) since 2008, which are tracked as part of the SeaStat process. In an effort to safeguard the privacy of our community, offense reports will only be located to the “beat” level. Location specific coordinates will no longer be provided. 

Beats are the most granular unit of management used for patrol deployment. To learn more about patrol deployment, please visit: https://www.seattle.gov/police/about-us/about-policing/precinct-and-patrol-boundaries. In addition to the Departments patrol deployment areas, these data contain the “Neighborhood” where the crime occurred, if available. This coding is used to align crime data with the Micro Community Policing Plan (MCPP). For more information see: https://www.seattle.gov/police/community-policing/about-mcpp. 

As with any data, certain condition and qualifications apply:

The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of statistical data.

Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people.  A census tract usually covers a contiguous area; however, the spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement.

These data contain offenses and offense categorization coded to simulate the standard reported to the FBI under the National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) and used to generate Uniform Crime Report (UCR) summary statistics. As these records evolve, daily and are continually refreshed, they will not match official UCR statistics. They represent a more accurate state of the record. 

Previous versions of this data set have withheld approximately 40% of crimes. This updated process includes all records of crime reports logged in the Departments Records Management System (RMS) since 2008, which are tracked as part of the SeaStat process. In an effort to safeguard the privacy of our community, offense reports will only be located to the “beat” level. Location specific coordinates will no longer be provided.

of a county or equivalent entity that are updated by local participants 
prior to each decennial census as part of the Census Bureau's 
Participant Statistical Areas Program. The Census Bureau delineates 
census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where 
state, local, or tribal governments declined to participate. The primary
 purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units
 for the presentation of statistical data.
Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 
people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. A census tract usually 
covers a contiguous area; however, the spatial size of census tracts 
varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Census tract 
boundaries are delineated with the intention of being maintained over a

Each row contains the record of a unique event where at least one criminal offense was reported by a member of the community or detected by an officer in the field. This data is the same data used in meetings such as SeaStat (https://www.seattle.gov/police/information-and-data/seastat) for strategic planning, accountability and performance management.  

These data contain offenses and offense categorization coded to simulate the standard reported to the FBI under the National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) and used to generate Uniform Crime Report (UCR) summary statistics. As these records evolve, daily and are continually refreshed, they will not match official UCR statistics. They represent a more accurate state of the record. 

Previous versions of this data set have withheld approximately 40% of crimes. This updated process includes all records of crime reports logged in the Departments Records Management System (RMS) since 2008, which are tracked as part of the SeaStat process. In an effort to safeguard the privacy of our community, offense reports will only be located to the “beat” level. Location specific coordinates will no longer be provided. 

Beats are the most granular unit of management used for patrol deployment. To learn more about patrol deployment, please visit: https://www.seattle.gov/police/about-us/about-policing/precinct-and-patrol-boundaries. In addition to the Departments patrol deployment areas, these data contain the “Neighborhood” where the crime occurred, if available. This coding is used to align crime data with the Micro Community Policing Plan (MCPP). For more information see: https://www.seattle.gov/police/community-policing/about-mcpp.

Annual benchmarking, reporting and disclosing of building performance are foundational elements of creating more market value for energy efficiency.

delineates census tracts in situations where no local participant 
existed or where state, local, or tribal governments declined to 
participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable
 set of geographic units for the presentation of statistical data.
Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 
people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. A census tract usually 
covers a contiguous area; however, the spatial size of census tracts 
varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Census tract 
boundaries are delineated with the intention of being maintained over a 
long time so that statistical comparisons can be made from census to 
census. Census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth or
 merged as a result of substantial population decline. <br /></div>",,,data.seattle.gov,,,true,,2018-11-08T19:23Z,https://hub.arcgis.com/api/v2/datasets/6002417deabe43639c95d55fd94ae3d6_8/license,https://data.seattle.gov/resource/p8td-3efa.json,,,,,2018-11-08T19:23Z,0,"2000,boundaries,cosgis,census,gis,planning,seattle,seattlecitygis,tract,wa,wm_census_tract00",Land Base,,href,p8td-3efa

Also, demolished buildings were removed from the data, and other changes to buildings, such as additions or partial demolition were reflected.  NOTE: All buildings that were not added or updated by Triathlon are directly from the 1993 Building data. Therefore most of the 1999 attribute data is actually exactly the same as the 1993 attribute data, including erroneous data. The vendor was not responsible for checking or correcting attribute data associated with existing buildings unless the building vectors required changes. For example, the 1993 orthophotography quality was quite poor in many areas and many buildings were coded as OBS because their outlines were simply not visible enough. With the 1999 orthophotography we now able to clearly make out most details that were not evident in the 1993 orthophotography. So you will see many buildings in the 1999 data coded as OBS that are clearly not obscured.  The poor quality of the 1993 orthophotography also interferes with sorting out the updated buildings from the old existing bldgs because many of the 1993 bldgs were not put in quite right due to the fuzzy 1993 ortho quality.

Buildings account for 33% of Seattle's core emissions. The benchmarking policy supports Seattle's goals to reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions from existing buildings. In 2013, the City of Seattle adopted a Climate Action Plan to achieve zero net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050. Annual benchmarking, reporting and disclosing of building performance are foundational elements of creating more market value for energy efficiency.
Per Ordinance (125000), starting with 2015 energy use performance reporting, the City of Seattle will make the data for all building 20,000 SF and larger available annually. This update to the benchmarking mandate was passed by Seattle City Council on February 29, 2016.

However, consolidating is favorable only where the rate of interests are high and hence an exorbitant amount of money remains to be paid off! It should be carried off only through agencies flexible enough and ones which can assure regular payments without a delay.

Tree canopy cover mapping was carried out using a semi-automated approach that coupled automated feature extraction with manual editing. Automated feature extraction was done using a rule-based expert system embedded within an object-based framework. Object-based image analysis techniques (OBIA) work by grouping pixels into meaningful objects based on their spectral and spatial properties, while taking into account boundaries imposed by existing vector datasets. Within the OBIA environment, a rule-based expert system was designed to effectively mimic the process of manual image analysis by incorporating the elements of image interpretation (color/tone, texture, pattern, location, size, and shape) into the classification process. A series of morphological procedures were employed to ensure that the end product is both accurate and cartographically pleasing.

To learn more about patrol deployment, please visit: https://www.seattle.gov/police/about-us/about-policing/precinct-and-patrol-boundaries.

As with any data, certain conditions and qualifications apply:

1)	These data are queried from the Data Analytics Platform (DAP), and updated incrementally on a daily basis. A full refresh will occur twice a year and is intended to reconcile minor changes.

2)	This data set only contains records of police response. If a call is queued in the system but cleared before an officer can respond, it will not be included. 

3)	These data contain administrative call types. Use the “Initial” and “Final” call type to identify the calls you wish to include in your analysis.
