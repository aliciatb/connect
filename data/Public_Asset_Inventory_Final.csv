Do not pull down the data set and use it without using the code book. When you run the data set, be sure to refer to the Code Book for invalid or missing values for each question item (variables).

This project is managed by our Community Technology Program with technical advice from our Citizens Telecommunications and Technology Advisory Board (CTTAB).  
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING DATA SET
Do not pull down the data set and use it without using the code book. When you run the data set, be sure to refer to the Code Book for invalid or missing values for each question item (variables). 
You must recognize that the data here is unweighted; to replicate the figures in the City’s Information Technology Access and Adoption Report and get values that are representative of Seattle population, you should use the weights. There are 2 weighting variables, one that allows you to use the phone and online survey together (labeled ""weightfin"") and one that is for only the phone survey (labeled ""wgtphoneonly"", which excludes or zeros out everyone in the online survey).",One Time,04/25/2014 09:34:00 PM,https://data.seattle.gov/d/s98k-8imb,dataset,True,official,,http://www.seattle.gov/tech/indicators,04/25/2014 08:34:00 PM,

Annual benchmarking, reporting and disclosing of building performance are foundational elements of creating more market value for energy efficiency.

Buildings account for 33% of Seattle's core emissions. The benchmarking policy supports Seattle's goals to reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions from existing buildings. In 2013, the City of Seattle adopted a Climate Action Plan to achieve zero net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050. Annual benchmarking, reporting and disclosing of building performance are foundational elements of creating more market value for energy efficiency.
Per Ordinance (125000), starting with 2015 energy use performance reporting, the City of Seattle will make the data for all building 20,000 SF and larger available annually. This update to the benchmarking mandate was passed by Seattle City Council on February 29, 2016.
