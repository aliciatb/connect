#### R Markdown and Knitr

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.

## Our Report
Unemployment Rate over time for Los Angeles County, courtesy of a code chunk in a R Markdown document. 
```{r LA County plot, error=T,echo=F, fig.width=10}
edd_url <- "https://data.edd.ca.gov/Labor-Force-and-Unemployment-Rates/Local-Area-Unemployment-Statistics-LAUS-/e6gw-gvii"
laus_data <- read.socrata(edd_url)

la_county <- laus_data %>% filter(`area_name` == "Los Angeles County" & `seasonally_adjusted_y_n` == "N")

ggplot(la_county) +
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x = date, y = `unemployment_rate`))
```

### Exploring Unemployment Rate

When exploring unemployment rate by County in the LA Metropolitan Statistical Area, something looks weird in the 2010s. 
Here, we create the plot in another code chunk. 

```{r la csa, error=T,echo=F, fig.width=10}
la_csa <- laus_data %>% filter(area_name == "Los Angeles County" | area_name == "Orange County" | area_name == "Ventura County" | area_name == "Riverside County" | area_name == "San Bernardino County" & `seasonally_adjusted_y_n` == "N")

ggplot(la_csa) +
  geom_line(aes(x = date, y = unemployment_rate, color = area_name))
```

### Validating the Unemployment Rate Dataset

Orange County's unemployment rate drops off a cliff in 2010, yet still has some bumps in the line during that decade. 

Here's our quick spot check of the dataset, counting months present in the data for each year for Orange County. 

```{r the oc, error=T, echo=F, fig.width=10}
the_oc <- laus_data %>% filter(area_name == "Orange County")
check_the_oc <- the_oc %>% group_by(year) %>% summarise(rown = length(unique(date)))

ggplot(check_the_oc) +
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x = year, y = rown))
```

With a click of "Knit" in RStudio, here's a report in an easily shareable HTML format, indicating that the data is missing some rows for Orange County. 

#### RMarkdown can be knit into many, many common formats including *Word*, *PDF*, *HTML*, and *slides*. Other packages extend on this allowing for *books*, *letters*, *blogs*, and *posters* to be knit from RMarkdown.
